# lang

Just a language that's still under development. If you still want to try it out, then do the following steps:
1. Clone repo via Git or GitHub
   - Via Git: `git clone https://github.com/notcl4y14/lang.git`
   - Via GitHub: Click the `<> Code` button, and then `Download ZIP`
2. Type in command line `npm install` (You should have node.js installed)
   - Since I forgot to put `ts-node` in `package.json`, type also `npm install --save-dev ts-node`
3. Now to run it, type `lang %*`, %* replace with arguments
   - If you don't have Windows, then type `ts-node --project ./tsconfig.json . %*`, %* replace with arguments
